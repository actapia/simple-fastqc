# simple-fastqc

This is an in-progress library for reading results from FastQC. The current
goal of this library is to provide a useful Python representation of FastQC
output.

Future versions of this library may also include support for running FastQC
analyses from Python code.

## Supported modules

- Overrepresented sequences
- Basic statistics

Raw data and status from other modules can also be accessed.
